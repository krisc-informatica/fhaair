# fhaair

An example exercise for the Mobile Information Systems course at FH-Aachen in the summer semester 2021

## Step 1: project creation

- The solution that is shared here has been created with the following command: 'flutter create --org de.fh_aachen.mis fhaair'
- When you want to distribute an app, the package name (org) cannot be the default name 'com.example'. So, here I have chosen the package name de.fh_aachen.mis. A package name cannot contain '-' as in fh-aachen
- The project name is fhaair (Fachhochschule Aachen Air)
